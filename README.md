# Gibbs Motif Sampler
The algorithm is based on the following two papers,
  1. Bayesian Models for Multiple Local Sequence Alignment and Gibbs Sampling Strategies, Jun Liu et al., JASA, 1995.
  2. The Collapsed Gibbs Sampler in Bayesian Computations With Applications to a Gene Regulation Problem, Jun Liu, JASA, 1994.

It is assumed that there is only one motif in the gene sequence with known length. The algorithm may also be used in similarity checking of articles. The parallelled and unparallelled versions are provided. Tested in Python 3.6, on Windows and MacOS.
